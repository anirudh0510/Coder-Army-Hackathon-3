# Introduction

Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web-based platform designed to help users understand and analyze different algorithms through dynamic visualizations.
The platform includes Sorting, Searching, Graph Traversal, and a unique Race Mode, making learning fun and engaging.It also have Racemode feature which will
let the user learn the speed and timecomplexities of such algorithms differently.

# Features

## 1. Sorting Algorithms

Supports Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

Adjustable array size and speed range dynamically updated on the UI.

## 2. Searching Algorithms

Includes Linear Search and Binary Search.

Users can set the array size and speed range.

Input field to enter the integer to search in the array.

## 4. Race Mode

Compares multiple algorithms dynamically.

Displays time complexities in real-time.

Features a leaderboard ranking algorithms based on execution time.

Separate racemodes for Sorting, Searching, and Graphs.

# How to Use

Select a category: Sorting, Searching, Graphs, or Race Mode.

Choose an algorithm from the available list.

Adjust parameters like array size and speed (where applicable).

Start visualization to see the algorithm in action.

Observe the execution and understand the working of different algorithms.

In Race Mode, compare execution times and check the leaderboard.


# Technical Details

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS

State Management: React Hooks

Animations & Visualizations: JavaScript & CSS Transitions(tailwind)

# Future Enhancements

Add more algorithms (e.g., Minimum Spanning Tree, Algorithm writer,etc).

Improve UI/UX with better animations and interactive elements.

Implement user authentication for saving scores and progress.

Add a challenge mode for users to predict algorithm performance.
