# Algorithms Visulaizer

An interactive algorithm visualizer application to help users understand algorithmic concepts through dynamic animations. The application features 5 sorting, 2 searching, and 3 graph algorithms, allowing users to explore these algorithms interactively. It also includes adjustable animation speeds for customized visualizations and options to observe algorithm behaviors on diverse datasets, enhancing the depth of analysis and comprehension. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, DSA, and Particles.js, this tool is designed to make learning algorithms more engaging and accessible.
